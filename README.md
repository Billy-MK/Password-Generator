# Password-Generator

## Description

This project was intended to exercise our ability to code Javascript to create a dynamic webpage. I created a password generator, which generates a random password based on parameters set by the user. 

The password generator consists of an HTML webpage constructed with Bootstrap and light custom CSS, along with a Javascript function to generate a random password. 

The Javascript function allowed me to practice creating a useful tool using Javascript, and reflect the data output from functions on a responsive webpage.
